      video-script:
        - do: "Click `Pulse`"
          say: "Pulse is the dashboard for your project. It gives you a high-level overview of the work that has been done and the work that is yet to be completed."
        - do: "Show `Period`"
          say: "You can use the period drop down to change the space of time you are reviewing. The default is the last week."
        - do: "Show `Overview`"
          say: "At the top of the page, you will see an overview of the issues, pull requests, and contributors to the project."
        - do: "Show details for pull requests and issues"
          say: "As you scroll down the page, you can view a detailed list of the pull requests that have been merged, the pull requests that are still open, the issues that have been closed, and the issues that have been opened. As you reach the bottom of the page, you will also see a section for unresolved conversations. These are issues that were opened outside of the timeframe you have selected and remain open."
        - do: "Click `Graphs`"
          say: "While pulse is the project overview, graphs are the place you can go to see the fine detail. Let's take a look at a few of the detailed graphs about our project."
        - do: "Click 'Contributions' drop down"
          say: "The contribution graph tells you who has added and deleted content from this repository and when they did it."
        - do: "Select a smaller timeframe"
          say: "You can narrow the window of time you are reviewing by selecting a smaller area in the timeline graph."
        - do: "Click `Punch card`"
          say: "You can use the punch card to see when the work happens in your repository."
        - do: "Click `Network`"
          say: "And you can use the network graph for a visualization of the open branches and the work that has been completed on each in relation to master."
