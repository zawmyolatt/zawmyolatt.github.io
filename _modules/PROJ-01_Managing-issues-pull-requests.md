      title: Managing Issues and Pull Requests
      video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5C6yXNaSGo
      video-script:
        - do: "Navigate to `Issues`"
          say: "Issues and pull requests are a great way to collaborate with your team. An active project may have a large number of open issues and PRs, so managing issues and pull requests is an important part of keeping your team on track."
        - do: "Click `Assignee`"
          say: "One of the first things you should do is make sure that every issue and pull request is assigned to someone on the team who is responsible for seeing it to completion. "
        - do: "Show `Assigned to nobody`"
          say: "You can easily find unassigned items by clicking on assigned to nobody."
        - do: "Select several issues > Assign to GitHubStudent"
          say: "You can assign mulitple items by selecting all of the tasks you would like to assign and then using the drop down to select the assignee."
        - do: "Click `Sort` > `Least recently updated`"
          say: "Issues and Pull Requests can easily pile up and grow stale if you do not intentionally prevent them from doing so. To keep your task lists clean, you can sort by Least recently updated to find the items that have not had recent comments or activity."
        - do: "Click `Sort` > `Oldest`"
          say: "You can also look at the oldest items to see if they are making progress. This can help you decide whether they need a helpful nudge or need to be closed."
        - do: "Click the `Labels` Dropdown"
          say: "Labels also help you keep issues and pull requests organized. For example, you can create labels for the type of task and even use them to queue up the next tasks to be worked within the group."
        - do: "Click `Labels` tab"
          say: "You can manage your project labels, including the name and color, using the labels tab. You will notice that this tab also provides a helpful way to see how many issues and pull requests currently have that label applied. In the next section, we will take a look at another tool for managing your team: Milestones."
